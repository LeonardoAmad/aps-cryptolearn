# 🔐 CryptoLearn — Interactive Cryptography Learning Platform
<center>
When we started this project, we wanted to make the **world of cryptography more accessible and visual**. Many people know that encryption protects their messages and passwords, but few understand *how* it actually works.  
That’s how **CryptoLearn** was born — a web application that brings together **education, interactivity, and design** to teach the foundations of **classic encryption techniques**, such as **Caesar Cipher**, **Substitution Cipher**, and **Transposition Cipher**.

Our goal is to turn complex cryptographic concepts into something fun and easy to understand, using **real-time simulations** that show how messages are encoded and decoded.

## 🧠 Objective

The main goal of **CryptoLearn** is to **promote practical learning about cryptography** and demonstrate how ancient methods inspired the **modern security systems** that protect our data today.  
Beyond education, it also aims to raise awareness about **data protection** and **digital security** in an increasingly connected world.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Python 3**
- 🌐 **Flask** — for backend logic and route management  
- 💻 **HTML5 & CSS3** — for structure and responsive design  
- ⚡ **JavaScript** — for interactivity  
- 🎨 **Futuristic and minimalist UI design**

---

## 🚀 Functionalities

✔️ Modern and intuitive interface  
✔️ Theoretical explanations for each cipher type  
✔️ Interactive simulators to encrypt and decrypt messages  
✔️ Implementation of the three main classical ciphers:
- Caesar Cipher  
- Substitution Cipher  
- Transposition Cipher

## 💡 Justification

**CryptoLearn** was created to make the concept of **cryptography understandable to everyone**.  
While most educational platforms focus on theory, we wanted to create a **hands-on and visual approach** where users can experiment and instantly see the results of their encryptions.  
By bridging history and technology, CryptoLearn helps users grasp **how ancient ciphers evolved into today’s encryption algorithms**.

---

## 🎯 Goal

From the start, our goal has been to build a **didactic and engaging experience** for students and enthusiasts interested in cybersecurity.  
We aim to be a **reference in educational cryptography tools**, combining simplicity, design, and functionality in one platform.

---

## 🧩 Materials and Methods

The project was developed using:
- **HTML** for the page structure  
- **CSS** for layout and futuristic styling  
- **JavaScript** for dynamic content  
- **Flask (Python)** for backend logic and cipher algorithms  

Each cipher (Caesar, Substitution, and Transposition) was implemented as a **modular Python script**, fully integrated with Flask routes and rendered through the web interface.

---

## 🔮 Expected Results

We expect **CryptoLearn** to become a tool that simplifies the teaching of classical cryptography in academic environments, offering both **theoretical and interactive content**.  
The long-term vision is to expand the platform to include **modern encryption algorithms** (like RSA and AES) and even concepts of **quantum cryptography**, keeping learning up to date with real-world applications.
